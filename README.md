# veesem 

veesem is an experimental V.Smile emulator. Game compatibility is generally quite good from what I have tested so far, though more features, a more advanced UI and better accuracy are future targets.

## Command line options

* Usage: `veesem [OPTIONS] CARTROM`
* Emulation options:
    * `-sysrom ROM` - Provide system ROM (otherwise dummy ROM without boot animation will be used)
    * `-pal` - Use PAL video timing (default)
    * `-ntsc` - Use NTSC video timing
* Visual options:
    * `-leds` - Show controller LEDs at startup
    * `-fps` - Show emulation FPS at startup

## Build instructions

* Required dependencies: SDL2, OpenGL
* Supported compilers: GCC or Clang with C++20 support. MSVC is not supported.

### Steps
1. Create a `build` directory and change working directory to it.
2. Run `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.
    - When building on Windows, you probably need to specify the path of your SDL2
      MinGW development package directory with `-DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH`,
      e.g. `-DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=~/SDL2-2.30.11/x86_64-w64-mingw32/`.
3. Run `make` or whatever the equivalent is in your preferred CMake generator.
4. You should now have a working `veesem` executable.
    - For Windows, remember to also copy the DLL from the SDL2 development package
      directory to the directory of the executable.
      The DLL can usually be found in `x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin`.
